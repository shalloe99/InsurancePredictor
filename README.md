# Insurance Charge Predictor

A Predictive Model for Personal Medical Insurance Charge

## Description

Medical insurance is an essential part of people’s self-protection plan as it covers a person’s medical
expenses for illness or injury. However, various factors of each individual may affect their medical
insurance charges, such as age, body condition, and more. We constructed a prediction model to estimate
insurance charges while providing more insights into the effect of each factor. 

This project utilized an
insurance dataset obtained from the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz. The data were
analyzed using JMP to examine the relationship between features indicating individual characteristics and
the corresponding health insurance charges.
